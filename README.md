# Hi there, I'm Daniel Lopes! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub space! 🚀

I'm a developer passionate about [**PHP**](https://github.com/topics/php) and a big enthusiast of [**Laravel**](https://github.com/laravel/laravel). Currently, I'm diving into new possibilities with [**Filament**](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament) for my new projects to build amazing and dynamic applications. Sometimes, I'm seeking random projects to collaborate on—open source is life. ❤️
